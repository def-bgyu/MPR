If you're a paramedic student or aspiring to be one, then CPR is one of your important areas that you must have a good grip. Performing CPR during an emergency can be a challenge even for a trained person. Therefore, you must make sure to remember and administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation steps correctly.<br>

Things to keep in mind before performing CPR <br>
Approach the patient safely. Don't take any unnecessary danger to yourself <br>
Check for the response by tapping the shoulders and asking loudly whether he or she is fine <br>
Ask someone to call the Ambulance <br>
Check for the presence of pulse in the neck for 5-10 seconds. Simultaneously, look for chest rise and fall <br>
If no pulse and breathing is found, start CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) <br><br>
<strong>A simple step-by-step guide for CPR - </strong><br><br>
Steps	Actions: <br>
Step 1: To perform CPR, keep your arms straight and cover the first hand with the heel of your other hand. Interlock the fingers of both hands together and keep them raised so that they do not touch the patientâ€™s chest.<br>
Step 2: Lean forward and make sure that your shoulders are directly above the patient's chest.<br>
Step 3: Press down on the chest about 2- 2.4 inches and release the pressure (let the chest come back up).<br>
Step 4: At the rate of 100-120 compressions per minute, give 30 compressions<br>
Step 5: Then tilt the head and lift the chin to open the airway and let the mouth fall open slightly.<br>
Step 6: Pinch the nose to shut it and take a normal breath and give mouth to mouth blow to the patient. Blow until you see the patient's chest rise<br>
Step 7: Watch the patient's chest fall and then repeat mouth to mouth breath again. Give a total of 2 breaths after 30 compressions.<br>
Step 8: Repeat the 30 chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths. Continue the cycle until the patient starts breathing again.<br></p>
